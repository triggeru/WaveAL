# WaveAL
WaveAL is a pet project and mod that locally unlocks downloaded skins.
Individual skin configurations are saved depending on region, account and server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project currently only supports EN servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project only runs on Windows 10/11.

Modifications are exclusively local, as we do not support harming other players' experiences.

## 🥰 Future updates
- Do something about adb
- Add support for other server regions

## 😟 Debugging
- If you see strange output in the output window, it would be a good idea to report it immediately!
- ```PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied.``` = Run the program with Administrator privileges.
